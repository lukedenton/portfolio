# Just For Fun
These are small projects that I've worked on, basically, just for fun. I either wanted to learn how to use a new technology,
figure out a way to implement UX from another website, or just solve a game!

## Keep Talking Solver

Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes is a very fun VR game. As a way to learn VueJS v2, I decided to create a "Keep Talking Solver".
The title is a bit misleading as it doesn't really solve the puzzles, it just helps with solving them. It's kind of like
having someone with a photographic memory on your team, who doesn't have to look at the defusal manual. The structure of
most of the puzzles meant it was a perfect excuse to create something using a new technology.


## Elevator Saga

[Elevator Saga](http://play.elevatorsaga.com) is a neat Javascript programming game that I found online. Basically you have to write the logic for
an elevator (and then eventually a set of elevators) to move between floors, picking up people and dropping them off.

I managed to write a solution that gets through most of the levels. The ones that my solution has trouble with is in elevator
movement efficiency, and not making people wait X seconds. My solution manages to pass the rest of the levels - but not
necessarily on the very first go, sometimes it depends on the input, i.e. when and which floor people call the elevator.

## Google Music Header
I recently signed up with Google Music for streaming music, and when looking through the site and the various music
available, I noticed what I thought to be a very neat UX for displaying a large artist image. I wanted to try
and replicate this UX, so I tried it out in JSFiddle.

I didn't want to place any restrictions on myself like creating it with only CSS, so I just went for it! CSS and Javascript

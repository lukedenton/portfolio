#Chrome Extensions

Below is a list of the extensions that I've created for the Google Chrome web browser. Under each heading, I'll provide
some information on why I created the extension, and then some of the main features, as well as a link to the
extension on the Chrome Web Store

1. Slack++
2. Assembla++
3. Google Services Launcher

##Slack++
This extension was initially created to add a copy button to text that is formatted using a single or tripple
backticks in slack. I use Slack at work everyday, and one of the very common uses is sharing code
snippets between developers. Code snippets at my workplace is almost exclusively posted using single
or triple backtick formatting, so it just made sense to add an easier way to copy that text.
  
A newer feature was adding a dark theme option for the site, as Slack doesn't offer much customization
for the conversation part of the interface. There are customization options for the sidebar, but
nothing for the part where the actual messages are posted - and the part that is mostly white!

##Assembla++
As Assembla is the issue tracker of choice at work, I had to write an extension to make it a at least a
little bit more usable. The first thing I added was the ability to click and drag the card wall.

The second
function was an update to the ticket pages themselves, reversing the order of the activity updates, so the newest
updates are at the top. This meant the user no longer has to scroll all the way to the bottom
of the page to be able to read the latest updates or to post a new comment. Further to reversing the activity history,
I recently added the ability to hide all activity updates that aren't user comments. In Assembla, all updates, be it
logged time, code commits, ticker assignment, comments - anything - gets posted in the activity history. There isn't
a simple way to view just the comments, which is usually the only thing I would want to see. There is already an option
to hide code comments (which are commit messages reference the current ticket), so all I had to do was hide the
other miscellaneous information, leaving just comments.

##Google Services Launcher
This was the first Chrome extension that I wrote. It's very simple in that it adds a button to the extensions panel that,
when clicked, displays all of the Google services. This is exactly the same as the 9-dot grid button that is shown
on most Google sites allowing a user to quickly change between the Google service they're using. I use many Google
services often, and have found this extension to be invaluable.

Before creating it, I search around the Chrome store for something that already achieves the same goal. I found one
extension that was practically exactly what I wanted to do, however it was very slow in showing the extension pop
up window, taking 1-2 seconds to load all the services. That was far too long for me, so I created this extension,
which shows the menu in under a second.

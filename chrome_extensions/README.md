# Chrome Extensions

Below is a list of the extensions that I've created for the Google Chrome web browser. Under each heading, I'll provide
some information on why I created the extension, and then some of the main features, as well as a link to the
extension on the Chrome Web Store

## Slack++
This extension was initially created to add a copy button to text that is formatted using a single or triple
backticks in slack. I use Slack at work everyday, and one of the very common uses is sharing code
snippets between developers. Code snippets at my workplace is almost exclusively posted using single
or triple backtick formatting, so it just made sense to add an easier way to copy that text.
  
A newer feature was adding a dark theme option for the site, as Slack doesn't offer much customization
for the conversation part of the interface. There are customization options for the sidebar, but
nothing for the part where the actual messages are posted - and the part that is mostly white!

## Google Services Launcher
This was the first Chrome extension that I wrote. It's very simple in that it adds a button to the extensions panel that,
when clicked, displays all of the Google services. This is exactly the same as the 9-dot grid button that is shown
on most Google sites allowing a user to quickly change between the Google service they're using. I use many Google
services often, and have found this extension to be invaluable.

Before creating it, I search around the Chrome store for something that already achieves the same goal. I found one
extension that was practically exactly what I wanted to do, however it was very slow in showing the extension pop
up window, taking 1-2 seconds to load all the services. That was far too long for me, so I created this extension,
which shows the menu in under a second.

## Fix Trello Boards Width
This extension was created in response to a design update that Trello implemented. In the new design, the container holding the list of user boards was limited to ~700px, which didn't look very good on my wide monitor, there was a lot of whitespace on either side that was being wasted. I submitted feedback to Trello about the design problem, but also decided to fix it myself in the mean time through an extension. The extension has been submitted to the Chrome, Firefox and Opera webstores.
